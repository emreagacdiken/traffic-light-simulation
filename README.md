ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Simulation

A basic Java application that simulates a traffic light system with a simple graphical user interface (GUI). 
This project serves as an educational tool to understand the fundamentals of GUI development and state management in Java.

Features

Traffic Light Simulation: Simulates the behavior of a standard traffic light with red, yellow, and green lights.
Simple GUI: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the traffic light changes.
State Transitions: Manages the transitions between different traffic light states with appropriate timing.â€‹

ðŸŽ® Usage

Upon running the application, a window will appear displaying the traffic light simulation. 
The lights will change colors in the standard sequence: red â†’ green â†’ yellow â†’ red, with each state lasting for a predefined duration.â€‹
